# Midi to Virtual Piano

Generate virtual piano sheet music from a midi file to play yourself or have your computer play it for you. Known to work well with [virtualpiano](https://virtualpiano.net) and Roblox Multiplayer Piano.


## Warning

This piano player portion of this program makes use of the python keyboard library which generates key presses programmatically. Antivirus software may (correctly) detect this as malicious activity! The executable were generated through a `pyinstaller --onefile`, which bundles a python program and its dependencies into a portable executable that requires no setup. Everyone is welcome to audit the source files and generate the executable for themselves.
