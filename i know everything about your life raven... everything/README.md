Alot of people are asking me "What Happened between you and Raven", I cannot explain it properly because alot has happened and it lasted for months

Note to Raven: Do not try to fucking make false claims about me, i know you deleted our DMS but i still saved it and you can't do anything about it

![image](https://github.com/NotHammer043/Random-Stuffs/assets/107131733/d2874e61-3c6a-496d-b6f2-d017d4fef401)

I tried my best to be loyal to you but you never really understood that, i chatted you everyday for a year, even in school. I was very afraid to lose you as a friend.

About DJBG:
- DJBG is a "Cheap" Jailbreak Cash selling service that basically gives you an account with the specified cash that you purchased.
- DJBG also sells robux, i remember it being 1k for 7-10$. He took advantage of one person by giving him/her more discount per 1k.
You can get it cheaper on other sites like adurite, sirhurt, and more.

I did a bunch of orders but i never earned any money from it

No arguments have happened during this since it was before May 1, 2023

Arguments that happened:
- Voice Reveal - May 1, 2023
- "Ignoring" As he claims because he doesn't fucking understand personal issues
- "You do not care anymore" just one mistake you make from this guy he will have a tantrum

About CTP:
- Raven made the idea of CTP as a tool to farm after byfron release, from my experience, he is a horrible business partner, when i was still coding CTP he already made a very early release date which forced me to literally break my sleep schedule by a ton, when the release date he promised was there, the software wasn't even done, instead he let people preorder the software when i wasn't even done with AutoLaunch + AutoInject. This pushed me even more and even got a bunch of people mad because we had "4" devs and it was taking a while for us to finish, the reality is i was the only one coding major parts of the project like AutoLaunch, AutoInject, CacheCleaner, Massconfig, and a bunch more, All Raven did was basic stuffs which anyone can do in less than 5 minutes with ChatGPT.

Some things that annoys me:
- He keeps trying to make useless updates.
He wanted to change the version from 1.2 to 1.3 with just 1 single command that i added

And when i refused to agree with his decision he gets mad. He decided to be more stupid by going 1.21, 1.22 in big updates and blames it on me. (Honestly what the fuck is wrong with your head? its just a single fucking command that isn't even worth that much to care about. How the fuck are you expecting to change the version to a big one after one non important command)
- Raven refuses to add more beta testers, when i finished working on an update i needed people to test it out and nobody was online. I asked raven to add more beta testers but he refused to. Alot of people wanted to be beta testers but he just says "We are full"
- He also refuses to give beta testers what they are suppost to test. He got mad at me for releasing a beta version which was literally the purpose of their role

- After finishing an update, he will not let you rest. He will already plan a big update and release it the very next day

You pushed the release date by a ton that i never got to test for any bugs, when we released it was day time. Everybody had a bunch of issues and since your from the other side of the world you were sleeping. I had to spend my entire day helping people and fixing bugs

How many times do i have to tell you that i have personal issues.

![image](https://github.com/NotHammer043/Random-Stuffs/assets/107131733/9ee868e3-95f2-4f30-8b21-b60eb8f79ebb)

I already told you a bunch of times that i have personal issues but not even a day you forget about it.

![image](https://github.com/NotHammer043/Random-Stuffs/assets/107131733/f42fffce-b835-46d9-aa8b-3fc3d5d3219a)

He says this but not even a week later he starts a new argument that doesn't make any sense

![image](https://github.com/NotHammer043/Random-Stuffs/assets/107131733/7e55c62d-4691-42f0-8e36-6f4361d40402)


He also blames me for starting all these arguments, he should ask himself why these happened.
He got upset because i was ignoring him and kept asking why are you doing this. Ask yourself.
Ask yourself these questions, not me. If you want to be a horrible friend then think to yourself "why did i do this?"

CTP - August 6, 2023:

CTP got exposed for "Malicously Logging" people, CTP's reputation got ruined not only because Tzech dickrides his partners (which hates CTP without even trying the software), but they also claimed that we were selling the data which is not true, it was only used for software protection, they also claimed that it would run when you open the software but in reality it would only run if the data sent did not match with the webserver's data

What it logged and its use:

IP = Ban people from the webserver

Bot Token = To see who owns the bot and see the user thats trying to tamper with the software

Screenshot = To make sure it wasn't a false alert


About Hunter:
- Hunter is a innocent guy, but for some reason he got accused of putting the Malicious stuff on the code (He doesn't even have access to the bot code and he only worked on the UI). I asked raven to atleast clear his name but he refused to (Most likely because he hated him)

Claims:
- Raven Claims that me and him did equal amount of work on CTP and tries to cancel the fact that i did majority of the work on CTP

The following images were taken by Crimsonfied

- Raven Claims that the arguments already happened after CTP was made, when in reality it started happening on May 1, 2023 when i decided to voice reveal on his friend first. (tantrum alert)

- Raven Claims that i maliciously added IP Logger, Bot Token Logger, Screenshot Desktop to the bot without consent and for my own use, when in reality i asked every dev if it should be added, Raven 100% agreed and i even i sent a bunch of screenshots + development of the function on the devs group chat and even on his DMS before it was released

Raven is also trying to ruin my image on some of my friends by private messaging them false claims.

Crimsonfied knows that i am a nice guy, i helped him with everything.
- Him trying to take advantage of Crimsonfied after hearing how good his PC is:

Crimsonfied only owed us 7k but raven wanted to take advantage more, he was going for 15k-20k which is bs

(Still decides to offer 15k)


nanoMIDI:
- Raven took my domain "nanomidi.app" and he claims that "Its his money" I sold all my devex robux for 50$ but what you did is buy random stuffs, you spent hundreds of dollars buying minecraft hacked clients. I never spent any of the money we both earned. You spent it all.

Raven's Common Sense:

(How is he suppost to know about CTP if he doesn't know CTP)

How did i feel afterwards:
- It took me a while to forget everything but it felt great afterwards, i finally get to take care of myself. And i also get to spend my OWN earnings.


I went silent for about a week but he claims that i was just on status (Imagine if i wasnt) after a while of being silent he started making threats and deleted a bunch of files and access


Raven will use you for what you have, he does not understand your (personal) issues and will always expect that you have time for him, he will always expect you to prioritize him. No matter how loyal you are he will never understand that.
